# Battler States

This plugin for RPG Maker MZ give battlers unique visual effects based on their states.

For example, you could add a "Vanished" state that includes `<effect:translucent>`. Whenever a character gains the Vanished state, their battler will look like the top battler in this first screenshot:

| translucent, white, blur, grain                                                  | outlines                                                    |
