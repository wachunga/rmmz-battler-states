# Battler States

This plugin for RPG Maker MZ give battlers unique visual effects based on their states.

For example, you could add a "Vanished" state that includes `<effect:translucent>`. Whenever a character gains the Vanished state, their battler will look like the top battler in this screenshot:

Supported effects (top to bottom order):

- `<effect:translucent>`
- `<effect:blur>`
- `<effect:grain>`
- `<effect:white>`
- `<effect:black>`
- `<effect:red>`
- `<effect:green>`
- `<effect:blue>`

I may add more in the future.
